What is this?
==
This is a quick and dirty prototype of a UI for adding blocks of land to one or more neighborhoods on a map.

How do I use it?
==
- Click a neighborhood on the left to activate it.
- You can also use the number keys to quickly switch between neighborhoods.
- Clicking a cell in the map toggles it from the active neighborhood.
